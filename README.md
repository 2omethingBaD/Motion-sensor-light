# Motion Sensor Light
##Overview
This repository includes the Arduino code and circuit diagram for my 2-mode motion sensor light. The project features a 3-mode switch, enabling users to select between different lighting modes: off, static on (no motion sensing), and motion sensing on.

## Circuit Design
### Configuration
The circuit is powered by a 9V battery and utilizes an AITIAO Nano V3.0 ATmega328P Microcontroller Board for seamless operation. It also includes a 5V relay switch for the motion sensor mode. The light source is a 9-11V LED with a maximum brightness of 120 Lumens.

## Final Assembly
###
The finished product incorporates a 3-mode switch: middle position turns the entire circuit off, left position activates static on mode (no motion sensing), and right position enables motion sensing. It's essential to note that the LED brightness differs between static on and motion sensing modes, with the latter having reduced brightness.
