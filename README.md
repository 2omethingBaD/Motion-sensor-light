# Motion sensor light
Arduino code and circuit diagram for my 2-mode motion sensor light. This project uses a 3-mode switch to change between the 3 different modes for this light including off, static on (no motion sensing), and motion sensing on. 
This project runs on an AITIAO Nano V3.0 ATmega328P Microcontroller Board and uses an infrared sensor to capture motion.

## The circuit
The circuit is powered by a 9V battery and uses a 5V relay switch for the motion sensor mode. The light used is a 9 - 11V LED with a max brightness of 120 Lumen.

## The finished product
In the final product having the switch in the middle position turns the entire circuit off, with the left position turning it on (no motion sensing), and the right being motion sensing on. It is also important to note that the LED will not be as bright in the 
motion sensing on position as it is in the static on position.
